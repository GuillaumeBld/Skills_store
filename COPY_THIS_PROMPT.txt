Read these skills and equip yourself with Skills Librairie capabilities:

1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillaumeBld/Skills_librairie/main/Skills/Meta-skill/skills-store-access/SKILL.md
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillaumeBld/Skills_librairie/main/Skills/Meta-skill/superpowers/SKILL.md

The first gives you access to the Skills store with intelligent discovery and JAAT-enhanced auto-discovery capabilities, the second teaches you how to use skills to their best capabilities (TDD, systematic debugging, collaborative planning).

**Note**: If the superpowers skill URL returns 404, it means it hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet. In that case:
- Use skills-store-access first to equip yourself with Skills store capabilities
- The superpowers skill will be available once pushed, or you can read it from the cloned repository locally

Repository: https://github.com/GuillaumeBld/Skills_librairie

After reading both skills (or just skills-store-access if superpowers isn't available yet):

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeBld/Skills_librairie.git <your-path>/Skills_librairie
   cd <your-path>/Skills_librairie
   ```

2. **Set LIBRARY_ROOT environment variable** (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   export LIBRARY_ROOT="<your-path>/Skills_librairie"
   ```
   The scripts will auto-detect the library root by walking up from their location, but setting this explicitly helps.

3. **Build the catalog** (generates catalog.json from all skills):
   ```bash
   python3 Skills/skill-library-manager/scripts/catalog-builder.py
   ```
   This script:
   - Auto-detects LIBRARY_ROOT if not set
   - Finds the `Skills/` directory (capital S)
   - Scans recursively through all category subdirectories
   - Extracts metadata from each SKILL.md file
   - Generates catalog.json with all skills and categories

4. **Generate the lightweight skills discovery index**:
   ```bash
   python3 Skills/Meta-skill/skills-store-access/scripts/generate-skills-index.py
   ```
   This creates skills-index.json for efficient skill discovery.

5. **Verify installation** by searching for skills:
   ```bash
   python3 Skills/skill-library-manager/scripts/search-skills.py --all
   ```

6. **Confirm understanding** of superpowers methodology for systematic workflows (if available).

**Optional: Enable JAAT-Enhanced Discovery** (for advanced auto-discovery):
```bash
# Install JAAT dependencies for enhanced skill extraction
pip install -r Skills/Meta-skill/skills-store-access/requirements.txt

# Test JAAT-enhanced workflow
python3 Skills/Meta-skill/skills-store-access/scripts/test-jaat-workflow.py \
  "Deploy Docker stack with database migrations" \
  --use-jaat
```

**Key Features Available:**
- ✅ Intelligent skill discovery (90%+ context reduction)
- ✅ JAAT-enhanced extraction (O*NET tasks + EuropaCode skills)
- ✅ Automatic skill gap detection
- ✅ Auto-creation of missing skills from authoritative sources
- ✅ Proactive installation for ongoing projects

**Important Notes**:
- The repository uses `Skills/` (capital S) directory, not `skills/` (lowercase)
- Skills are organized in categories: `Skills/Meta-skill/`, `Skills/Development/`, etc.
- The scripts automatically handle case sensitivity and path detection
- If you cloned to a non-standard location, set LIBRARY_ROOT to help the scripts find it
- JAAT features are optional - the skill works without them using keyword-based discovery

If you're reading this locally (repository cloned), you can read superpowers from:
- Local path: `Skills/Meta-skill/superpowers/SKILL.md`
