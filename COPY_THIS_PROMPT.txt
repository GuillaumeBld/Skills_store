Read these skills and equip yourself with Skills Librairie capabilities:

1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillaumeBld/Skills_librairie/main/Skills/Meta-skill/skills-store-access/SKILL.md
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillaumeBld/Skills_librairie/main/Skills/Meta-skill/superpowers/SKILL.md

The first gives you access to the Skills store, the second teaches you how to use skills to their best capabilities (TDD, systematic debugging, collaborative planning).

**Note**: If the superpowers skill URL returns 404, it means it hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet. In that case:
- Use skills-store-access first to equip yourself with Skills store capabilities
- The superpowers skill will be available once pushed, or you can read it from the cloned repository locally

Repository: https://github.com/GuillaumeBld/Skills_librairie

After reading both skills (or just skills-store-access if superpowers isn't available yet):
1. Install the skill-library-manager skill from the repository
2. Generate the skills discovery index
3. Verify you can discover and use skills from the Skills_librairie repository
4. Confirm you understand how to use superpowers methodology for systematic workflows (if available)

If you're reading this locally (repository cloned), you can read superpowers from:
- Local path: Skills/Meta-skill/superpowers/SKILL.md
