# Loki Mode: Multi-Agent Autonomous Startup System

**Orchestrates 37 AI agents across 6 swarms to build, deploy, and operate a complete startup from PRD to revenue.**

Comprehensive multi-agent system for autonomous startup development, from initial product requirements to revenue generation, using orchestrated AI agent swarms.

**Original Repository:** [asklokesh/claudeskill-loki-mode](https://github.com/asklokesh/claudeskill-loki-mode)

## What It Does

Orchestrates complete startup lifecycle:
- **Product Development** - From PRD to MVP
- **Infrastructure Setup** - Deployment and DevOps
- **Business Operations** - Revenue generation and operations
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - 37 agents across 6 specialized swarms
- **Full-Stack Development** - Frontend, backend, database, APIs
- **Automated Workflows** - End-to-end automation

## Architecture

**6 Specialized Swarms:**
1. **Product Swarm** - Product requirements and design
2. **Development Swarm** - Code implementation and testing
3. **Infrastructure Swarm** - Deployment and DevOps
4. **Business Swarm** - Revenue and operations
5. **Quality Swarm** - Testing and quality assurance
6. **Coordination Swarm** - Orchestration and communication

**37 Specialized Agents:**
- Product managers, designers, developers
- DevOps engineers, QA testers
- Business analysts, marketers
- And more specialized roles

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Operation** - Agents work independently and collaboratively
- **Swarm Coordination** - Specialized swarms for different domains
- **End-to-End Coverage** - From PRD to revenue
- **Full-Stack Development** - Complete application development
- **Business Operations** - Revenue generation and management
- **Self-Improving** - Agents learn and adapt

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/asklokesh/claudeskill-loki-mode.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy skill to your skills directory
cp -r claudeskill-loki-mode ~/.claude/skills/loki-mode
```

## Usage Examples

### Initialize Startup Project

```bash
# Start Loki Mode for new startup
node loki-mode.js --init --prd product-requirements.md

# Orchestrates agents to:
# - Analyze PRD
# - Design architecture
# - Plan implementation
# - Begin development
```

### Orchestrate Development Swarm

```bash
# Focus on development tasks
node loki-mode.js --swarm development --task "build authentication system"

# Agents collaborate to:
# - Design auth system
# - Implement backend
# - Build frontend
# - Test integration
```
