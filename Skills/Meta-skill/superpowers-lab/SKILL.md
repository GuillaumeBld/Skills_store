# Superpowers Lab: Experimental Skills

**Experimental skills for Claude Code Superpowers.**

New techniques that are still being refined and tested. Skills here may change over time as they're refined and move to the main superpowers repository.

**Original Repository:** [obra/superpowers-lab](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-lab)

## What It Does

Provides experimental skills that:
- Test new techniques and approaches
- Explore cutting-edge workflows
- Refine methods before moving to production
- Experiment with skill composition and interaction

**Note**: Skills in this lab are experimental and may change. They represent ongoing research and development.

## Installation

```bash
# Install from superpowers-marketplace plugin
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers-lab@superpowers-marketplace

# Or clone directly
git clone https://github.com/obra/superpowers-lab.git

# Copy skills to your skills directory
cp -r superpowers-lab/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Relationship with Main Superpowers

- **superpowers** (main repo): Stable, production-ready skills
- **superpowers-lab** (this repo): Experimental skills being tested
- Skills graduate from lab to main repo when stable

## Skills Available

Skills in superpowers-lab are constantly evolving. Check the repository for current experimental skills:

**Repository:** https://github.com/obra/superpowers-lab/tree/main/skills

**Examples of experimental skills:**
- New workflow patterns
- Experimental debugging techniques
- Cutting-edge testing approaches
- Advanced skill composition methods

## Using Experimental Skills

**When to use:**
- Exploring new techniques
- Testing cutting-edge approaches
- Contributing to skill development
- Research and development work

**When NOT to use:**
- Production-critical work (use main superpowers instead)
- Stable, repeatable workflows
- When consistency is critical

## Resources

- **Original Repository**: https://github.com/obra/superpowers-lab
- **Main Superpowers**: https://github.com/obra/superpowers
- **Blog Post**: See repository for blog post about its development

## Key Takeaways

1. **Experimental** - Skills here are being tested and refined
2. **May Change** - Expect changes as skills evolve
3. **Contribute** - Feedback and contributions welcome
4. **Graduation** - Successful skills move to main superpowers repo

**Remember**: Experimental skills enable innovation, but use stable superpowers for production work.
